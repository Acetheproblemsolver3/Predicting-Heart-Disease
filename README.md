# Predicting Heart Disease
Heart Disease Prediction Using KNN Algorithm (ML Project)"
This project implements a K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm, a supervised machine learning technique, to predict the likelihood of heart disease based on given patient data. The model is trained and tested using a dataset containing medical and clinical attributes.

The project demonstrates the power of machine learning in healthcare, showcasing how predictive models can assist in early detection and prevention of heart diseases.
