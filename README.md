# Predicting Heart Disease 
Heart Disease Prediction Using KNN Algorithm (ML Project)"
This project implements a K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm, a supervised machine learning technique, to predict the likelihood of heart disease based on given patient data. The model is trained and tested using a dataset containing medical and clinical attributes.

The project demonstrates the power of machine learning in healthcare, showcasing how predictive models can assist in early detection and prevention of heart diseases.
Key Features
Algorithm: K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
Supervised Learning: Predicts binary outcomes (presence/absence of heart disease).
Input Data: Patient information such as age, cholesterol levels, blood pressure, etc.
Output: Likelihood of heart disease.
Evaluation: Measures accuracy to assess model performance.
